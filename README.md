- todo-redux : this is a mini project which includes a todo app with the help of redux toolkit. in this project i've learned about hooks like useSelector, useDispatch, and Provider to simplify state management in React applications.
  Note :

1. **Store**:
   - Created with `configureStore` to hold application state.
2. **Slices**:
   - Use `createSlice` to define actions and reducers for specific features.
3. **Provider**:
   - Wrap the app with `<Provider>` and pass the store to make it available across components.
4. **Dispatch Actions**:
   - Use `useDispatch` to send actions to the store.
5. **Access State**:

   - Use `useSelector` to retrieve state from the store.
